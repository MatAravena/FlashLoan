# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

``` Another commands
npm install --save-dev hardhat
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run .\scripts\deployFlashLoan.js --show-stack-traces
```

``` Deploy 
npx hardhat run --network goerli .\scripts\deployFlashLoan.js

```
